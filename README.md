# Vision Transformers implementation

This repository contains a Pytorch implementation for several Vision Transformers papers.

## Vanilla ViT
The Vanilla ViT can be trained of different datasets using `train_vit.py`
The hyper parameters haven't beem finely tuned for each dataset but the performance should correct by default.
